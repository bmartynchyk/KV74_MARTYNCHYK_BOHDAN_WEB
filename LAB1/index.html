                                            presidency, by far. Nobody's ever
                                            been more successful than me. I'm
                                            the most successful person ever to
                                            run. Ross Perot isn't successful
                                            like me. Romney &mdash; I have a
                                            Gucci store that's worth more than
                                            Romney. Sorry losers and haters, but
                                            my IQ is one of the highest &mdash;
                                            and you all know it! Please don't

                                          asset management entrepreneurship, and wealth creation. 98% students gave positive 
                                          reviews while studying, however some of these ungrateful gringos filed lawsuits 
                                          against Trump University after the course. I had to pay $25 million to settle that...

                                          (and there is another annual fee for members, it is very expensive to be rich). 
                                          That year I also opened a casino called Trump Castle. My wife Ivana became

                                          critic Paul Goldberger say in 1983 that the tower's atrium is "the most pleasant 
                                          interior public space to be completed in New York in some years". At the same 
                                          time I also started a repair job on the Wollman Rink in Central Park and 
                                          completed the work in three months for $1.95 million, which was $775,000 less
